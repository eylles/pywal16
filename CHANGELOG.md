This is a big release and I've probably broken something. Expect a minor release or two to fix any bugs that arise. ~~Users of `wpgtk` I recommend not updating `pywal` until @deviantfero adds support for the new release.~~ `wpgtk` is now supported.

It's going to take me some time to update the documentation (*I've got a total rewrite planned*). Bear with me.

## General


- xrdb: Added missing `background` and `foreground` values.
- image: Fixed crash when using light themes and gifs.
- args: Added `-t` to disable `pywal` in ttys.

- misc: Added proper logging to `pywal`.

## Backends

`pywal` now has support for different color generation backends. In addition to `pywal`'s default color generation, support was added for:

- `schemer2`: https://github.com/thefryscorer/schemer2
- `colorthief`: https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py
- `colorz`: https://github.com/metakirby5/colorz
- `haishoku`: https://github.com/LanceGin/haishoku

Usage:

- `wal --backend` lists all available backends.
- `wal --backend colorz -i img.jpg` sets the backend.
- `wal --backend random` uses a backend at random.

If you know of any other color generation programs let me know and I'll see if I can add backends for them.


## Themes

You can now store colorschemes in files and manage them using `pywal`. There are a bunch of colorschemes included with `pywal` and I will happily accept PRs to add more.

- `wal --theme` lists all available built-in themes.
- `wal --theme theme-name` applies a theme.
- `wal --theme random` applies a theme at random.
- Themes can be added locally at `~/.config/wal/colorschemes`.
- `wal --theme` can be used with colorschemes exported in `json` format from https://terminal.sexy/.
` wal --theme /path/to/file` loads a scheme from a file.

\[[Installation](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Installation)\] \[[Getting Started](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Getting-Started)\] \[[Customization](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization)\] \[[Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki)\]


This release of `pywal` contains some large changes and may very well break things for some users. Expect bugs and expect additional releases to fix them. The version has been bumped to `1.0.0` as I'm now happy with where `pywal` is feature-wise.

The goal for the future is improving the schemes that `pywal` generates. Feel free to send me your wallpapers that generate subpar schemes and I'll use them in my testing data.


### Removal of `-r`

The flag `-r` was removed as it was basically a glorified `cat` of the `sequences` file with **300ms** of python overhead. The new recommended way to load the schemes is to replace `wal -r` with `cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences`.


### Removal of `-t`

Yup! The `-t` flag to fix garbage in VTE terminals (termite, xfce4-terminal, gnome-terminal) is no longer needed. I've come up with a workaround that really **shouldn't work** but does. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

The problem: The sequence  `\033[708;#000000\007` is unsupported by VTE and VTE's sequence parsing doesn't hide unknown sequences, instead it just displays them as plain text. We can't add an if statement or a check for VTE terminals as we're writing to each terminal via it's file descriptor. The only thing that is interpreted is escape sequences.

The workaround: The problem sequence is wrapped in a series of other escape sequences so that the unsupported sequence isn't echo'd to the terminal.

How it works:

```
# \0337                # Save cursor position.
# \033[1000H           # Move the cursor off screen.
# \033[8m              # Conceal text.
# \033]708;#000000\007 # Garbage sequence.
# \0338                # Restore cursor position.

\0337\033[1000H\033[8m\033]708;#000000\007\0338
```

This took a lot of trial and error to make sure it works across all terminals and doesn't cause issues for underlying terminal programs.


### Added User Template Support

You can now define your own custom `pywal` template files or you can overwrite the default template files. Any files stored in `~/.config/wal/templates` will be processed and exported to `~/.cache/wal/` under the same name.

The user template files follow the exact same syntax as the built-in templates. See the built-in templates for syntax examples: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/tree/master/pywal/templates

For example: To define a custom `rofi` template file to set the background transparent.

Save this file to `~/.config/wal/templates/colors-rofi.Xresources` and re-run wal. Rofi will now use the colors defined below instead.

```
#define BG #CC{background.strip}
#define HI #CC{color1.strip}
#define FG {color15}
#define TX {color15}

! State:           bg, fg, bg2,  hlbg, hlfg
rofi.color-normal: BG, FG, BG,   HI,   TX
rofi.color-active: BG, FG, BG,   HI,   TX
rofi.color-urgent: BG, HI, BG,   HI,   FG
rofi.color-window: BG, BG, BG
```
